# Stuart Little Simulator
We have developed an immersive experience taking
inspiration from radio-controlled toy cars. Our IoT-based bot is
remote-controlled over the internet and has a camera mounted
on it whose feed is live-streamed to a VR headset. The userâ€™s head
movement controls the rotation of the camera. The web interface
used to navigate the bot supports both keyboard input and
popular console controllers. We explored and analysed several
video streaming techniques and user interfaces to maximise
immersion and ease of use.
